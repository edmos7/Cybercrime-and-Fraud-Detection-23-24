In the context of the course, techniques used to spot fraudulent behavior were highlighted, as a project assignment amounting to 50% of the final grade, I developed this code that deeply analyzes the dataset, although I don't think it is a balanced or trustworthy one given the strange sampling characteristics it shows. 
The jupyter notebook file contains the code and comments exploring the data, while the pdf dcument is a standard paper discussing the findings; you also can analyze the same data by looking at the amazon reviews 2 dataset.

This project was developed between April and May of 2024
